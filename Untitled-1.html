        <div class="poem">
            <p>beneath the weight of the early morning light,<br>
               everything is slow,<br>
               as if the world was caught in a deep breath waiting to be exhaled.
            </p>

            <p>the sky, stretching out endlessly,<br>
               is not blue, nor gray,<br>
               but just a soft smear of color that fades in every direction,<br>
               dissolving into the horizon where the sea lies still.
            </p>

            <p>the ocean sings,<br>
               not with sound,<br>
               but with the movement of its waves pushing and pulling,<br>
               its always present but each sound will never be the same.
            </p>

            <p>The sand I stand on is cool,<br>
               damp from the night and the ocean,<br>
               each step leaving behind an indent in the ground,<br>
               an indent that will be soon washed away.
            </p>

            <p>the wind, brushing against my skin like a memory that is almost lost,<br>
               but still lingers,<br>
               the heartbeat of the sea, the pulse of the wind, the quiet shuffle of the sand,<br>
               all blending into one continuous flow.
            </p>

            <p>the clouds, barely there, thin, stretched out,<br>
               almost transparent as they drift across the wide expanse of the sky,<br>
               unhurried, unshaped, like thoughts passing.
            </p>

            <p class="light-blue">time itself feels different,<br>
               slower, stretched out,<br>
               as if the world has forgotten the rush and business of the day,<br>
               suspended in the soft breath of the morning.
            </p>

            <!-- Last three paragraphs with light blue text -->
            <p class="light-blue">it is that in this place,<br>
               this moment,<br>
               that boundaries blur.
            </p>

            <p class="light-blue">the line between the sky and the sea,<br>
               earth and air,<br>
               all dissolving into the soft edges of the morning.
            </p>
